### MechMania 30
On September 21-22, 2024, I participated in a hackathon as staff rather than as a participant for the first time. I was responsible for the visualizer as shown below. More info on the [github repo](https://github.com/MechMania-30) and [website](https://www.mechmania.org/).

### Fall CTF 2024
On September 22, 2024, I quickly stopped by for [Fall CTF 2024](https://2024.fallctf.com/)'s electronic badge. I only had time to do a few challenges (same day as MechMania), but it was pretty fun.

### Chipotle
Back in my sophomore year, the Chipotle on Green Street gave me such a criminally small portion, I've never been back to that location since.
